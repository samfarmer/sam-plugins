# Weekly News Plugin

**Impact-scored weekly news research and reporting for any industry or topic**

## What This Plugin Does

This plugin helps you create comprehensive weekly news reports with structured impact scoring. It's designed for professionals who need to stay informed about developments in their industry and want a systematic way to identify what matters most.

Instead of manually scanning dozens of sources and wondering which stories are significant, this plugin:
- Searches authoritative sources systematically
- Scores each story using customizable impact criteria
- Compiles findings into a professional formatted report
- Saves time while ensuring comprehensive coverage

## Who Should Use This

- **Industry analysts** tracking developments in their sector
- **Executives** who need weekly briefings on market trends
- **Consultants** monitoring multiple industries for clients
- **Researchers** following emerging topics systematically
- **Anyone** who wants structured news monitoring instead of ad-hoc searching

## What You Get

A weekly report including:
- **8-12 high-impact stories** scored on relevance and significance
- **Business context** explaining why each story matters
- **Source links** for verification and deeper reading
- **Trend analysis** identifying patterns across stories
- **Consistent format** making reports easy to scan and compare week-over-week

Reports typically run 1,500-2,500 words and take 7-10 minutes to read.

## How to Use It

### Quick Start

1. Run the command: `/weekly-news`
2. Answer a few questions about what you want to research
3. Claude compiles the report automatically
4. Your report is saved and ready to review

### What You'll Be Asked

**Topic**: What industry or subject to research (insurance, AI, healthcare, etc.)

**Time period**: How far back to look (usually past 7 days)

**Save location**: Where to save the completed report

**Sources** (optional): Any specific websites or publications to prioritize

### Customizing Impact Scoring

The plugin uses "impact scoring" to rank stories by importance. Different topics need different scoring criteria:

- **Insurance** might score on: Industry reach, Financial impact, Regulatory significance, Technology innovation, Timeline urgency
- **Technology** might score on: Adoption potential, Technical advancement, Market disruption, Investment magnitude, Implementation timeline
- **Healthcare** might score on: Patient impact, Regulatory implications, Cost effects, Clinical evidence, Coverage timeline

The plugin either uses predefined scoring for common industries or helps you create custom criteria for your topic.

## What Makes This Different

**Structured methodology**: Not just keyword searches - follows a systematic research process

**Impact-driven**: Focuses on what matters, not just what's recent

**Reproducible**: Same process each week means consistent quality

**Customizable**: Adapts to any industry or topic area

**Shareable**: Reports are professional enough to share with colleagues or clients

## Examples and Templates

The plugin includes a detailed **insurance industry example** showing:
- Complete 5-dimension impact scoring framework
- 20+ authoritative sources
- Scoring examples for different story types
- Search strategies and quality checklists

Use this as a template for building your own topic-specific approach.

## Tips for Best Results

**Be specific about your topic** - "Insurance industry" works better than just "insurance news"

**Define your audience** - Knowing who reads the report helps focus the analysis

**Review the first report together** - Provide feedback on scoring and source selection to refine future reports

**Establish a routine** - Weekly cadence builds a valuable archive over time

**Save reports consistently** - Use the same folder structure to track progress over time

## Adapting to Your Industry

While the plugin includes detailed insurance guidance, it works for any topic:

1. **Identify your key sources** - What publications, analysts, and regulators cover your space?
2. **Define what matters** - What dimensions of impact are most relevant? (Financial? Regulatory? Technical?)
3. **Set scoring criteria** - How do you distinguish high-impact from low-impact stories?
4. **Run a pilot** - Generate one report and refine based on results

The methodology is domain-agnostic - it's about systematic research, not industry-specific knowledge.
