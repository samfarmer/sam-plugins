# Weekly News Research Methodology

This skill provides a systematic approach to researching, scoring, and compiling weekly news for any industry or topic area.

## Overview

The weekly news research process follows these steps:
1. **Source identification** - Determine authoritative sources for the topic
2. **Story compilation** - Search and gather relevant stories from the past week
3. **Impact assessment** - Score each story using domain-specific criteria
4. **Analysis and synthesis** - Identify patterns, trends, and implications
5. **Structured reporting** - Present findings in a consistent format

## Core Principles

**Impact-driven curation**: Not all news is equally important. Use structured scoring to identify stories that matter most to your audience.

**Multi-source verification**: Draw from diverse sources including trade publications, research firms, regulatory bodies, company announcements, and specialized analysts.

**Context over volume**: Better to provide deep analysis on 5-8 high-impact stories than superficial coverage of 20 items.

**Actionable insights**: Focus on business implications, strategic considerations, and what readers should do with the information.

## Impact Scoring Framework

### Designing Your Scoring Criteria

Every industry has different drivers of significance. Design 4-6 scoring dimensions that capture what matters in your domain, each scored 1-5 points.

**Effective scoring dimensions are:**
- **Measurable** - Clear criteria for assigning 1 vs 5 points
- **Relevant** - Tied to your audience's concerns and decision-making needs
- **Balanced** - Mix of different impact types (financial, operational, strategic, temporal)
- **Comprehensive** - Together, they capture most forms of significance

### Example Dimension Types

**Scope dimensions:**
- Market reach (local → regional → national → global)
- Stakeholder impact (single company → sector → entire industry)
- Regulatory breadth (one state → multi-state → federal → international)

**Magnitude dimensions:**
- Financial impact (cost/revenue implications)
- Operational impact (process changes, resource requirements)
- Competitive impact (shifts in market position or dynamics)

**Temporal dimensions:**
- Implementation urgency (immediate → 6 months → 1 year → 2+ years)
- Duration of effect (temporary → months → years → permanent)

**Strategic dimensions:**
- Innovation potential (incremental improvement → transformative change)
- Risk exposure (minimal → moderate → significant → critical)
- Precedent value (routine → notable → industry-changing)

### Setting Point Values

For each dimension, define what earns each point level:

- **5 points** - Highest significance, industry-defining impact
- **4 points** - Major impact, affects multiple stakeholders significantly
- **3 points** - Moderate impact, notable but contained
- **2 points** - Limited impact, niche relevance
- **1 point** - Minimal impact, marginal significance

### Total Impact Score

Sum scores across all dimensions. For a 5-dimension framework with 5 points each, maximum score is 25 points.

**Typical thresholds:**
- **20-25 points** - Critical stories, lead coverage
- **15-19 points** - High priority, substantial coverage
- **10-14 points** - Moderate priority, concise coverage
- **5-9 points** - Low priority, brief mention or exclude
- **Below 5** - Exclude unless filling out report

## Source Identification

### Source Categories to Consider

**Trade Publications**
- Industry-specific news sites and magazines
- Professional association publications
- Sector-focused newsletters

**Research and Analysis**
- Consulting firm reports (McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte, Accenture)
- Industry analyst firms
- Think tanks and research institutes

**Regulatory and Policy**
- Government agencies overseeing the sector
- Legislative tracking services
- Compliance news sources

**Company Sources**
- Earnings reports and investor relations
- Press releases and company blogs
- Executive interviews and presentations

**Specialized Coverage**
- Technology-focused publications (if relevant)
- Financial news covering the sector
- Regional/geography-specific sources

**Academic and Technical**
- Industry conferences and proceedings
- Academic journals (for emerging research)
- Patent filings and technical documentation

### Source Selection Criteria

Choose sources that are:
- **Authoritative** - Recognized expertise and credibility
- **Timely** - Publish frequently, cover breaking news
- **Comprehensive** - Broad coverage across the domain
- **Accessible** - Available via web search or direct access

Aim for 10-20 primary sources that together provide complete coverage of your topic area.

## Story Compilation Process

### Search Strategy

1. **Use broad searches first** - Search for general terms related to your topic and date range
2. **Then go specific** - Search for known companies, products, regulations, or sub-topics
3. **Check primary sources directly** - Visit key trade publications and scan headlines
4. **Follow cross-references** - Stories often reference related developments worth investigating

### What to Include

**Include stories that:**
- Represent new developments or announcements within the time period
- Have clear business or strategic implications
- Affect multiple organizations or stakeholders
- Set precedents or signal trends
- Involve regulatory, legal, or policy changes

**Exclude stories that:**
- Are purely opinion pieces without new information
- Duplicate coverage of the same event (consolidate instead)
- Fall outside the scope of your topic area
- Lack credible sourcing or verification
- Are too granular for your audience's needs

### Coverage Balance

Aim for diversity across:
- **Story types** - Mix of regulatory, financial, operational, technological, and market news
- **Companies** - Include large players and smaller innovators
- **Geography** - Represent relevant markets and regions
- **Sentiment** - Balance positive developments, challenges, and neutral analyses

## Analysis and Synthesis

### Trend Identification

Look for patterns across stories:
- **Recurring themes** - What topics appear in multiple stories?
- **Momentum** - Are certain issues gaining or losing attention?
- **Contradictions** - Do any stories present conflicting signals?
- **Gaps** - What important areas have no news (which is itself notable)?

### Implications Analysis

For each story and for the week overall, consider:
- **Strategic impact** - How should organizations respond?
- **Competitive dynamics** - Who wins and loses from this development?
- **Future outlook** - What does this suggest about coming months?
- **Risk factors** - What uncertainties or challenges does this create?

### Special Sections to Consider

Depending on your topic, include:
- **Spotlight** - Deep dive on the single most significant development
- **Trend Watch** - Analysis of emerging patterns
- **What to Watch** - Upcoming events, decisions, or announcements
- **Data Snapshot** - Key metrics or statistics from the week

## Reporting Guidelines

### Structure and Length

- **Total length** - Aim for 1,500-2,500 words depending on story count
- **Lead stories** (20-25 points) - 150-200 words each
- **Major stories** (15-19 points) - 100-150 words each
- **Moderate stories** (10-14 points) - 75-100 words each
- **Brief mentions** (5-9 points) - 50 words or exclude

### Story Elements

Each story should include:
- **Headline** - Clear, specific, and compelling
- **Impact score** - Prominently displayed with point total
- **Companies/entities** - Key players involved
- **Details** - What happened, why it matters, implications, timeline
- **Sources** - Links to original reporting for verification

### Writing Style

- **Active voice** - Direct and engaging
- **Business focus** - Emphasize strategic and operational implications
- **Accessible language** - Explain technical terms, avoid unnecessary jargon
- **Objective tone** - Present facts and analysis, not advocacy
- **Contextual** - Help readers understand significance even if unfamiliar with details

### Quality Checks

Before finalizing:
- [ ] All stories have impact scores with clear justification
- [ ] Sources are cited with working links
- [ ] Company names are clean and consistent
- [ ] Analysis explains "so what?" for each story
- [ ] Trends or patterns are identified across stories
- [ ] Timeline information is included where relevant
- [ ] Report is formatted consistently using the weekly-news-format skill
